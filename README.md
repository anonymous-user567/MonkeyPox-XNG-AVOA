# An Explainable Nature-Inspired Framework for Monkeypox Diagnosis: Xception Features Combined with NGBoost and African Vultures Optimization Algorithm

##  Abstract

The recent global spread of monkeypox, especially in non-endemic regions, has raised significant public health concerns. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical for effective disease management and control. In response, this repository presents a novel deep learning-based framework for **automated detection of monkeypox from skin lesion images**, leveraging:

- **Transfer Learning** via the Xception model for feature extraction,
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction,
- **Natural Gradient Boosting (NGBoost)** for classification, and
- **African Vultures Optimization Algorithm (AVOA)** for hyperparameter tuning.

The model was trained and evaluated on the publicly available **Monkeypox Skin Lesion Dataset (MSLD)** and achieved **97.53% accuracy**, **97.72% F1-score**, and **97.47% AUC**.

Additionally, Grad-CAM and LIME visualization techniques are employed to enhance model interpretability.
